## Introduction
Scroll Genesis aims to revolutionize crowdfunding by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. It provides a decentralized and transparent platform for individuals and organizations to raise funds for their projects, causes, or initiatives. By utilizing the Scroll Genesis Blockchain, Scroll Genesis ensures the security and immutability of transactions while empowering users with control over their funds.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were utilized in the development of Scroll Genesis:

- **React**: The frontend of Scroll Genesis is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables us to create dynamic and interactive components, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Solidity**: Scroll Genesis smart contracts, responsible for handling the logic and storage of funds, are written in Solidity. Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Key Features
Scroll Genesis provides the following key features:

- **Crowdfunding Campaigns**: Users can create crowdfunding campaigns to raise funds for their projects. They can set a funding goal, duration, and provide details about their initiatives.

- **Contributions**: Users can contribute funds to campaigns they are interested in supporting. Contributions are securely processed through the Scroll Genesis Blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

- **Smart Contracts**: Scroll Genesis utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity to handle the transfer and storage of funds. Smart contracts enable secure and trustless transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

- **Decentralization**: Scroll Genesis operates on the Scroll Genesis Blockchain, a decentralized network that provides transparency, security, and immutability. Users have full control over their funds and can trust the integrity of the platform.

## Architecture
Scroll Genesis follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built with React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. It communicates with the backend through the Gateway RPC, which interacts with the Scroll Genesis Blockchain.

The backend consists of smart contracts written in Solidity. These contracts handle the crowdfunding logic, including campaign creation, contribution processing, and fund distribution. The smart contracts are deployed on the Scroll Genesis Blockchain, ensuring secure and decentralized execution.
